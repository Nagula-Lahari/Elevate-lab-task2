# To-Do List Web App

A simple and interactive To-Do List web application built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (with Tailwind CSS for utility styling). This project demonstrates fundamental front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI updates without relying on any external frameworks.

## âœ¨ Features

  * **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your list using an input field and an "Add Task" button.
  * **Mark as Complete:** Toggle tasks as complete or incomplete by clicking a dedicated "Complete" button, which applies a strikethrough style.
  * **Remove Tasks:** Delete unwanted tasks from the list with a "Remove" button.
  * **Instant UI Updates:** All actions (add, complete, remove) reflect immediately on the page without requiring a refresh.
  * **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

  * **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
  * **CSS3 (Tailwind CSS):** For styling the application with utility-first classes, providing a clean and modern look.
  * **JavaScript (ES6+):** Vanilla JavaScript handles all the dynamic functionality, including DOM manipulation and event listeners.

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to get the To-Do List app up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download Files):**
    If you're using Git, clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK_HERE]
    cd your-todo-list-repo
    ```

    Alternatively, you can simply download the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files and place them in the same folder.

2.  **Open with Live Server (Recommended):**

      * **Install Live Server VS Code Extension:** If you don't have it, open VS Code, go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`), search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey, and install it.
      * **Open the Project in VS Code:** Go to `File > Open Folder...` and select the folder where your files are located.
      * **Launch:** Right-click on `index.html` in the VS Code Explorer sidebar and select "Open with Live Server".

    Your default web browser will automatically open the To-Do List app, and any changes you save to the code will instantly refresh the page.

3.  **Open Directly in Browser (Alternative):**
    You can also simply navigate to the folder where you saved the `index.html` file and double-click it. This will open the app in your default browser, but you'll need to manually refresh the page after making any code changes.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Learned

This project was designed to reinforce several core front-end development concepts:

  * **DOM Manipulation:** Creating, appending, and removing HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript (`document.createElement()`, `appendChild()`, `remove()`).
  * **Event Handling:** Attaching event listeners (`addEventListener`) to respond to user interactions like clicks and key presses.
  * **Dynamic UI Updates:** Ensuring the user interface reflects changes in real-time without full page reloads.
  * **State Updates:** Managing the visual state of tasks (e.g., completed vs. incomplete) by toggling CSS classes (`classList.toggle()`).
  * **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Practicing modern JavaScript features and syntax without reliance on libraries.
